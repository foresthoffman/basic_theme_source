The Basic Theme built with _s
===

I wanted to build a basic theme that I could potentially use in other projects. I did my best to avoid adding any unnecessary frills or anything that would require a great deal of overhead to update. Since _s has a wonderful launching point for theming with Sass, I stuck with the modular route. I made liberal use of variables and used mixins, without wasting too much time over-modularizing.

This theme is more for my personal use than anything else. However, I thought that someone may find it useful or inciting, so this repo contains all the source code for building out the theme.

Remember to remove unnecessary files and directories like `.git`, `.gitignore`, `.DS_Store` (Mac OSX), and `sass` before distributing. You could do that manually—if you're into that—or you could just use the build system i've prepared in my [wp_theme_ops](https://github.com/foresthoffman/wp_theme_ops) repo.

Enjoy!
